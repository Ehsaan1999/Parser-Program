       5         parties appearing remotely and that the witness

      18         the question and responsiveness of the answer

       1         Q.    Okay.  Let's see how much you can

       2    remember.  So not this accident but the one before

       3    that, do you recall around what year?  And it doesn't

       4    have to be perfect.  If you want to give me a range,

       5    that's okay too.

       6         A.    I was about to say about like 2018, 2019

       7    I had a accident.  I was about to say it's been a

       8    while.  It's been a while, like 2018, 2019.

       9         Q.    Okay.  You don't have to -- don't hurt

      10    yourself.  It's okay if you can't figure it out.

      11    Were you injured in that collision?

      12         A.    Yes, ma'am, I was.  In the one that I was

      13    in, yes, ma'am.

      14         Q.    Okay.  Do you recall how you were injured

      15    or what your injuries were?

      16         A.    I think it was like my shoulder, my left

      17    shoulder.  I think that was it.

      18         Q.    Did you get treatment for that left

      19    shoulder?

      20         A.    Yes, ma'am.  I went to like a chiropractor

      21    over there in Augusta, Georgia, for my shoulder.

      22         Q.    Do you happen to remember --

      23         A.    It had popped out of socket.

      24         Q.    Oh.  Do you remember the name of that

      25    chiropractor or the -- not the actual chiropractor



                                     11



       1    but like the company, the office?

       2         A.    No.  No, ma'am.  Honestly --

       3         Q.    Okay.

       4         A.    -- I really don't.  It was a small

       5    chiropractor.  I could tell you that much.  It wasn't

       6    no big ones.

       7         Q.    And the accident itself, was that in

       8    Augusta as well?

       9         A.    Yes.  Yes.  Yes.

      10         Q.    And for that particular case in

      11    2008 [sic], 2019, did you have to get an attorney for

      12    that case?

      13         A.    Yes, ma'am.  I went -- and I went, well,

      14    with Mike Hostilo.

      15         Q.    Well, I -- yeah, I'll -- yeah, and I want

      16    to just keep it to, you know --

      17         A.    Oh, I'm sorry.

      18         Q.    -- if you got an attorney.

      19         A.    Okay.

      20         Q.    So before this 2018, 2019 collision, you

      21    said there was one before that.  Do you recall around

      22    what year that happened?

      23         A.    It was probably about 2016, 2017.  They

      24    was probably like a year or two years apart, I want

      25    to say.  It wasn't right back to back.  It was like a



                                     12



       1    little space in between that.  It was like the first

       2    accident I've ever been in.  I think I was all

       3    like what?  About 20, 19 or 20 when I got in my first

       4    one.

       5         Q.    Okay.  And for this collision, the 2016,

       6    2017, were you injured in that collision?

       7         A.    No, ma'am.  It was just like a -- no,

       8    ma'am.  I -- basically, no, ma'am, I was not hurt.

       9         Q.    Now, have you been in any collisions where

      10    you were at fault?

      11         A.    Yes.  That's the -- that's the one I was

      12    at fault.  Basically, I hit someone at the back.

      13    They slammed on brakes, but, you know, the police

      14    really don't want to hear none of that.  But I did

      15    hit them, so I did take responsibility of that,

      16    so . . .

      17         Q.    Okay.  Let's talk about this accident, the

      18    one that happened in 2023.  Were you in the vehicle

      19    alone?

      20         A.    Yes, I'm a vehicle by myself.

      21         Q.    No.  At the time of the accident we're

      22    here for today, you were in the vehicle alone?

      23         A.    Oh, in the accident?  Yes.

      24         Q.    Yes.

      25         A.    Yes, ma'am, I was in the vehicle by



                                     13



       1    myself.  Yes, ma'am.

       2         Q.    And I'm sorry.  I didn't make it clear.

       3    I'm switching gears a little bit to this accident.

       4         A.    No.  You're okay.

       5         Q.    Okay.  And do you remember what time of

       6    day it was?

       7         A.    I don't know the specific time.

       8         Q.    Like morning, afternoon, night?

       9         A.    But it was in the afternoon, though, for

      10    sure.  It was daylight.  I mean, you could see

      11    everything, so it really wasn't no excuse, so . . .

      12         Q.    And do you recall where you were coming

      13    from and where you were going?

      14         A.    Yes.  I had just -- I had just came from

      15    out the Enterprise from Mulkey Road.  Okay.  Did you

      16    just ask where I was coming from or where I'm going

      17    -- and then where I'm going to?

      18         Q.    Yes.  Both.

      19         A.    Okay.  Well, I was coming from the

      20    Enterprise, and I was heading back to my home address

      21    at 19 Willow Lane, Riverdale.  So I was headed back

      22    to Riverdale.  I tried to rent a car, but I had to go

      23    to the -- I had to go to the bank and get some money

      24    out of the -- I had to go get some cash.

      25         Q.    So at the time of the collision, you



                                     14



       1    weren't in the rental yet.

       2         A.    No, ma'am, I was not in a rental.  I was

       3    in my deceased mother's car.  (Unclear audio).

       4               THE COURT REPORTER:  I didn't quite hear

       5         the last few words, sir.  You got kind of

       6         garbled.  You were in your deceased mother's

       7         car, and then, I didn't hear what else you said.

       8               THE WITNESS:  Basically, I was in my mom's

       9         car that passed away.  That was it.  That's all

      10         I said.

      11         Q.    (By Ms. Douglas)  And can you describe in

      12    your own words how the collision occurred.

      13         A.    Okay.  So I want to make this very clear

      14    how this road was.  It was only a -- it's a four-lane

      15    road, but you know it's split in two ways, like,

      16    oncoming traffic, then going traffic; correct?

      17         Q.    Okay.

      18         A.    So I was in the far left lane.  The far

      19    left lane goes straight, but the right lane that he

      20    was in makes a right.  So you can only go right in

      21    the lane that he was in 'cause we was approaching the

      22    stop sign.

      23               So basically, when we was going around the

      24    curve, he merged over and hit me on my side and made

      25    me spin into a -- into a -- a Uber -- a Uber parking



                                     15



       1    lot or something.  And he was saying that I was

       2    trying to -- I was trying to cut in front of him to

       3    -- to go to the Uber place, to the -- to the Tesla

       4    place.  I think it was a Tesla, Uber, whatever, but

       5    they was renting out Ubers and stuff.

       6               He was saying that I was trying to turn

       7    into there.  And I'm like, sir, why in the hell would

       8    I want to turn into a Uber place?  I'm not even a

       9    Uber driver, bro.  You know what I'm saying?  So it

      10    didn't make sense to me, but -- but that's what

      11    happened.

      12               He was basically going around the curve.

      13    You know when people go around a curve, they try to

      14    swing on over to the -- to the other lane they're

      15    supposed to be in, 'cause, like I said, that right

      16    lane that he was in was just a right turn lane.

      17    Well, once we got to the stop sign, he was only able

      18    to go to the right.

      19         Q.    Let me make sure --

      20         A.    The lane I was --

      21         Q.    -- I --

      22         A.    Ma'am?

      23         Q.    I'm sorry.  I want to make sure I

      24    understood correctly.  So you guys are going

      25    straight.  And then --



                                     16



       1         A.    Yes.

       2         Q.    -- the lane is going, and it's you -- did

       3    you-all -- you-all approached the intersection at

       4    that time?

       5         A.    No.  We have -- we didn't even make it to

       6    the intersection.

       7         Q.    Okay.

       8         A.    We didn't make it to the stop sign.  We

       9    had a collision around that sharp curve.  See, right

      10    before you get to the stop sign, it's a sharp curve.

      11    So once we was taking this curve, he was easing over

      12    into my lane, trying to get behind me.

      13               So I'm just assuming from driving all

      14    these years that he just miscalculated where he went

      15    to, because if you see my car, the pictures, the guy

      16    hit me dead on my side.  You get what I'm saying?  He

      17    made me spin.  You get what I'm saying?

      18         Q.    Yeah.

      19         A.    So --

      20         Q.    So the impact --

      21         A.    -- that's -- that's what I took from it.

      22         Q.    Okay.  So the impact --

      23         A.    Yes, ma'am, I'm listening.

      24         Q.    -- happened in the -- the impact happened

      25    in the lane you were already in; is that accurate?



                                     17



       1         A.    You said the impact happened in the lane

       2    that he was in?

       3         Q.    No.  You were in.  So if you-all are

       4    traveling and when you-all collided, were you in the

       5    lane that -- had you -- were you in the lane that you

       6    had been traveling in the whole time?  Does that make

       7    sense?  Like, did the impact happen --

       8         A.    Yes, I was in --

       9         Q.    Okay.  Go ahead.  Explain.

      10         A.    Go ahead.  Go ahead.

      11         Q.    No.  I was just making sure.  So --

      12         A.    Oh.  Basically, I was in a -- oh, I think

      13    this thing is gone out.  It's kind of slow a little

      14    bit.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.

      15         Q.    No.  I want you to finish.  I'm going to

      16    stop talking, but I think there is a delay.

      17         A.    Basically, I was in the left-hand lane.

      18    He was in the right-hand lane.  And once we was going

      19    around the curve, he merged over into my lane.  Once

      20    he merged over to my lane, hit me on the side, it

      21    made me spin around.

      22         Q.    Now, the lane he was in, were there

      23    indicators that -- that his lane was getting ready to

      24    end if he didn't turn?

      25         A.    Yes.



                                     18



       1         Q.    Okay.

       2         A.    And, you know, like on the -- on the road,

       3    it's got the little arrows and stuff.  It had -- it's

       4    white as day.  Only with the arrow turning right,

       5    that's the only way he can go.  So, I mean, I'm . . .

       6         Q.    Now, were you-all --

       7         A.    That's when --

       8         Q.    -- traveling side by side, or were you a

       9    little in front of him and -- or vice versa?

      10         A.    I was -- I was a little in front of him.

      11    I had him by like a car length.  So basically, he --

      12    his bumper was right there by my back passenger tire.

      13    So he was going straight.  I was going straight.  And

      14    once we went around that curve, that's when he tried

      15    to merge over, and that's how he hit me right there

      16    on that -- on that passenger door and messed up my

      17    passenger tire.  You get what I'm saying?  Like, it

      18    messed up all of that.  I don't know if my attorney

      19    showed you guys the pictures.

      20               But, I mean, even the officer there -- I

      21    mean, I don't know why it took this long to even get

      22    this case to settle 'cause, I mean, the proof was in

      23    the pudding.  The tire marks was in the road.  The

      24    guy literally came over to my lane.  You get what I'm

      25    saying?  So I'll just say I didn't understand it all.



                                     19



       1         Q.    So when you -- so when you final -- when

       2    you-all finally stopped, did you speak with the other

       3    driver?

       4         A.    No.  I -- the officer didn't let us speak.

       5    So I just heard him yelling, oh, he tried to turn in

       6    front of me to go over here to this Uber building.

       7    And I'm -- and I'm looking at him the whole time.

       8    I'm like, sir, I don't even drive Uber, bro.  And I'm

       9    so way -- I'm past the entrance into this -- this

      10    building on my right-hand side.

      11               I am literally like a whole car length in

      12    front of the entrance.  So to be able to turn into

      13    that parking lot, I would definitely -- I would have

      14    had to stop and make a whole U-turn to even go in

      15    that parking lot.  You get what I'm saying?

      16               So I take responsibility when I'm wrong,

      17    but I just couldn't take responsibility for that

      18    because I'm like, sir, you -- you sound ridiculous,

      19    man.  Like, you're saying that I'm trying to go to

      20    rent a darn Uber and I just left Enterprise.  Like,

      21    why would I want to come down here and rent a darn

      22    Uber?  Like, it didn't make sense.  You know what I'm

      23    saying?  But I get it, like.

      24         Q.    So who called the police?

      25         A.    We both did.  I know I got on my phone



                                     20



       1    instantly, like, because I have CDLs.  Like, stuff

       2    like this affects my job.  This is how I provide for

       3    my family is by driving every single day, so I'm kind

       4    of cautious into what I do and how I operate a

       5    vehicle.  So I -- that just kind of --

       6         Q.    No.  I understand.  My father's been

       7    driving for -- I don't know -- 40 years, maybe.  So

       8    I --

       9         A.    For any --

      10         Q.    So when you-all -- when the collision

      11    happened, no one got out of their vehicle until the

      12    police came?

      13         A.    You said did we get out of our vehicles?

      14         Q.    Yeah.  So did you get out of the vehicle

      15    and assess your damage or assess each other's damage?

      16    Did any of that happen before the officer came?

      17         A.    Well, I about to -- I don't know.  Yes.

      18    Yes, we both got out.  We both got out of the

      19    vehicle.  But the -- I think -- I want to say the

      20    officer -- the officers was there, though.  That's

      21    what I want to say.  The officer was there.  But --

      22    but I know I called the police while I was in the

      23    car, though.

      24         Q.    Okay.  How long did it take for the police

      25    to come?



                                     21



       1         A.    Believe it or not, they was kind of there

       2    on time.  So I want to say it probably took them

       3    what?  A good 15, 20 minutes 'cause the guy going --

       4    the way he hit me and the air bag exploded, man, I

       5    was kind of -- I was kind of dizzy to be -- to tell

       6    you the truth.  So I know I didn't just jump straight

       7    out of the car like everything was just fine.  I just

       8    sat there and called the police.

       9               And once the police arrived, I jumped out.

      10    I explained my situation.  And then the guy -- that's

      11    when I heard the guy over there yelling and doing all

      12    of that.

      13         Q.    Okay.

      14         A.    So the police officer put the guy in

      15    the -- at fault when we left the accident.  But then,

      16    once I got my attorney, that's when -- that's when

      17    all this new stuff came up to me, saying that -- that

      18    the officer didn't put anyone at fault.  So I -- I

      19    didn't understand that.

      20               And he seen the tire marks.  Like, we

      21    literally looked at them, like . . .

      22               THE COURT REPORTER:  Ms. Douglas, are you

      23         still with us?

      24               THE WITNESS:  Yes, I'm here.

      25               THE COURT REPORTER:  I'm talking about the



                                     22



       1         attorney.  She's frozen, here screen.

       2               MR. NICHOLS:  Yeah, Mr. Harris, there's

       3         just a slight delay.  The attorney for the other

       4         side, her computer is frozen.

       5               THE COURT REPORTER:  Yeah, just hold up

       6         just a second.  She's not responding.  She may

       7         have to log out and log back in.

       8               (Off the record.)

       9               MS. DOUGLAS:  I'm so sorry.  I got kicked

      10         off my network.  I'm sorry, Mr. Harris.

      11               THE WITNESS:  Oh, no.  You're okay.

      12         Q.    (By Ms. Douglas)  So the police came

      13    rather quickly.  About 15 to 20 minutes, they were

      14    there?

      15         A.    Yes, ma'am.  They didn't -- it wasn't --

      16    it wasn't a long waiting time.

      17         Q.    And you said that the other person -- that

      18    you didn't get the citation?

      19         A.    Say that -- you said other per -- you said

      20    I didn't get -- say that again, please.

      21         Q.    So who got the citation?

      22         A.    The other guy.  The other guy that was in

      23    -- that was involved.  He -- I think he was in, like,

      24    a burgundy or a red car, I want to say.

      25         Q.    Okay.  And did you -- did you go to the



                                     23



       1    court hearing, to the --

       2         A.    Did I go to a court hearing?

       3         Q.    Well, yeah.  'Cause you said that the

       4    officer -- you were discussing the officer and how he

       5    was at fault, and it changed.  And I guess my

       6    question is:  Did you go to the court hearing when

       7    that happened?

       8         A.    Oh, no, ma'am.  My attorney told me that

       9    the officer changed --

      10         Q.    Okay.  You can't tell me --

      11         A.    -- changed the --

      12         Q.    -- anything -- you can't tell me anything

      13    your attorney told you, no matter what case it is.

      14    Okay?

      15         A.    Oh.

      16         Q.    And that's for your protection.  Okay?

      17         A.    Okay.

      18         Q.    So you were also talking about how your

      19    air bags deployed.  And so the damage of your

      20    vehicle, you said it was on the passenger's side by

      21    the passenger tire?

      22         A.    Yes, ma'am.

      23         Q.    Okay.  And was your car totaled?

      24         A.    Yes, ma'am.  That was a very -- it was a

      25    very special car to me, the only thing my mom left



                                     24



       1    behind.  That's why I drove that thing with love and

       2    care, ma'am.  I wanted to put that thing up.

       3         Q.    Did the air bags deploy?

       4         A.    Yes.

       5         Q.    Were you wearing your seat belt?

       6         A.    Yes, ma'am.

       7         Q.    And you also discussed or you had

       8    mentioned that you had felt dizzy.  Were you

       9    experiencing any pain at that time?

      10         A.    Well, I was -- basically, I was dizzy.  I

      11    was feeling, like, shocked, scared, nervous, I mean,

      12    'cause it came out of nowhere.  You get what I'm

      13    saying?  Like, I seen him.  Like, when we was

      14    driving, I seen the car.  It's not like I wasn't

      15    aware of him right here on my bumper.

      16               I just didn't expect -- I just didn't get

      17    this -- I didn't expect for me to spin out the way I

      18    did, so that kind of just sent me in a whole little

      19    loophole.  I don't know how to explain the way I was

      20    feeling, but I -- I mean, I was kind of -- that's

      21    probably one of the worst accidents I done been in,

      22    honestly.

      23         Q.    And when you spun out, did your car hit

      24    anything?

      25         A.    Did I hit anything?  No.  I know I grabbed



                                     25



       1    my wheel.  I want to say, like, my back tire just hit

       2    the curb or something.  I didn't hit no other car or

       3    no light pole or nothing like that.  But I definitely

       4    would've if I didn't hold my wheel, 'cause the way --

       5    the way I -- like, the way when he hit me, the way I

       6    spun out, if you didn't hold that wheel, man, that --

       7    and, man, it ain't no telling where I would have

       8    ended up at.

       9               But I'm -- luckily that I had some type of

      10    experience in this thing, so I held onto my wheel so

      11    I didn't cause no further accidents or no further

      12    damage to anything or anybody else's property,

      13    so . . .

      14         Q.    So you didn't answer the -- so did you

      15    have any pain, though --

      16         A.    Yes.

      17         Q.    -- at that time?

      18         A.    Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.

      19         Q.    And where did you have pain?

      20         A.    Right on my -- my shoulder started back

      21    hurting.  And then when I went to the doctor, I had

      22    a -- like, in my back, I had a -- man, what's that

      23    thingy called?  Basically, my back will never be the

      24    same.  The doctor said a hem -- it's not a

      25    hemorrhoid.  I don't know.  I done forgot the



                                     26



       1    terminology the doctor had used.

       2               But I do -- but I do have serious damage

       3    to my back, my spinal cord 'cause, like I said, when

       4    they -- when they hit me, I mean, I had got whiplash

       5    like crazy.  So, I mean, I did get -- I did get

       6    injured.  They said it probably won't never go away,

       7    so . . .

       8         Q.    Now, you said -- you said hemorrhoid.  But

       9    did you mean a herniation?

      10         A.    Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm so sorry.  I know I

      11    sound so slow and ignorant.

      12         Q.    No.  It's --

      13         A.    I promise you I'm not.  That's what they

      14    told me, and I forgot about it 'cause --

      15         Q.    We know they're not the same thing.

      16         A.    -- I'm the type of guy that don't really

      17    go to the doctor and stuff.  So I didn't go back to

      18    the doctor after that, so . . .

      19         Q.    Listen, I just wanted to be clear 'cause

      20    those are not the same thing.  So okay.

      21         A.    I am so sorry.

      22         Q.    Okay.  So herniation in your back.  Okay.

      23    So right after this collision, where did you go?

      24         A.    I went to a -- I want to say that day I

      25    went to an urgent care.  I want to -- I went to a



                                     27



       1    urgent care.  And immediately after urgent care, I

       2    went to a chiropractor and some other back and spine

       3    doctors and all of that.  That's where I got the

       4    information from.  I had a CAT scan, all that stuff.

       5    That's my first time to have one of those.

       6         Q.    So the same day you went to urgent care.

       7    Do you remember which urgent care you went to?

       8         A.    No, ma'am.  It wasn't -- my sister's

       9    husband actually took me 'cause I didn't have a car.

      10    So I'm not actually sure which urgent care I went to,

      11    but it was in Atlanta, Georgia, of course, but I

      12    don't know the name of the street.

      13         Q.    Okay.  And do you think it was the same

      14    day, or was it the same week that you went to the

      15    chiropractor?

      16         A.    Did I go to urgent care and the

      17    chiropractor in the same week?  That's your question?

      18         Q.    Yes.  'Cause you said right after the

      19    collision, you went to urgent care, and then you went

      20    to the chiropractor.  I wanted to make sure that you

      21    -- were you saying you went the same day, or were you

      22    saying you went later?

      23         A.    Yes, ma'am, I went later.  I didn't go

      24    that same day 'cause I had to get everything set up

      25    with my attorney and everything --



                                     28



       1         Q.    Okay.

       2         A.    -- so I can be able to go.  But I think --

       3    most likely, I think it was that same week.  But I --

       4    I just know for sure after the accident, I went to

       5    urgent care 'cause, like I said, I was not feeling --

       6    I was not feeling right, ma'am.

       7         Q.    And just to be clear, so at this time, you

       8    were having that pain in your shoulder that had came

       9    back, and you were having pain in your back.  Are

      10    those the only areas of pain that you had?

      11         A.    Yes, ma'am, that I can recall that I --

      12    that was actually really serious and I had to get

      13    treatment on.  Like to this day, my shoulder, my left

      14    shoulder, and my back is still messing with me to

      15    this day.

      16               So like I said, I don't feel like those --

      17    'cause I tore a ligament in my shoulder, but -- and

      18    then, like I said, I got the herniation in my -- in

      19    my back and my -- between my disks in my spine.  So,

      20    I mean, I was kind of juked around a little bit.

      21         Q.    And just to be clear, the torn ligament in

      22    the shoulder happened in the previous accident; right?

      23         A.    Yes, ma'am.  And it just -- after this guy

      24    hit me, it just made it worser.  Like, it made it

      25    worse.  Like, I don't know how to explain that either



                                     29



       1    to you, but, I mean, the doctors really couldn't do

       2    too much for me.  I was still in pain after the

       3    treatment, during the treatment.  I didn't never

       4    really get no pain relief, honestly.

       5         Q.    Have you ever had surgery on the shoulder?

       6         A.    No, I have not.  And that's one of the --

       7    I -- I -- I'm scared of -- like, no.  No, ma'am, I

       8    don't think I'm --

       9         Q.    Have you ever been recommended for it?

      10         A.    Yes, I was.  The doctor that -- when I got

      11    in this accident, the doctor told me something about

      12    surgery for my shoulder, but I denied it only because

      13    -- only because I just -- I just -- I'm -- like I

      14    told you, I'm a single father.  So if I'm out of work

      15    and I'm just down, who's going to take care of my

      16    daughter?  Before -- that's before me and my wife got

      17    back together.  You get what I'm saying?

      18               So we was in Atlanta, just me and her, so

      19    it would have just been way too much, and it would

      20    have been way too expensive for me to even afford it.

      21    They told me the price, and the price was -- was,

      22    ooh, too much for me.  I didn't have insurance for

      23    one, and so I just -- like, I just tried to suck it

      24    up.

      25               Like, they gave me shots in my shoulder.



                                     30



       1    They gave me shots in my back.  They told me that's

       2    like the -- that's like a relief.  It did relieve it

       3    for like a day or two, though, honestly.  They put

       4    that little needle, that little long needle in

       5    between your bones and shoot it up with some juices

       6    and stuff.  I mean, they did that for my shoulder and

       7    my back for me, though.

       8         Q.    Do you remember what kind of injections

       9    they were?  Was it cortisone, or was it like a --

      10         A.    I don't know the -- I don't even want to

      11    wreck my brain up with what the -- the terminology

      12    the doctors used.  But it was some stuff that -- that

      13    it -- it felt good.  I know when they put it in my

      14    back, I had to have someone to drive me.  They said I

      15    couldn't come up there and get it without anyone else

      16    there.

      17               So I want to -- I want to say that was

      18    like -- literally like surgery, I want to say,

      19    because I couldn't -- I couldn't drive myself after

      20    the procedure, so it wasn't a big thing.  But they

      21    ain't opened me up or nothing, but they did stick

      22    like a little telescope in my back and all that, all

      23    kind of stuff.  They was doing all kind of stuff to

      24    me, honestly.

      25         Q.    How many of those procedures did you have?



                                     31



       1         A.    Talking about for this?

       2         Q.    Well, yes, for this.  Did they do that

       3    procedure more than one time or just did it that one

       4    time?

       5         A.    How many times did they do it?  I think

       6    only -- I want to say I got that shot about one or

       7    two.  I'm not sure.

       8         Q.    Okay.

       9         A.    It was like probably one time, one in

      10    each.  So I know I got one in my shoulder.  I got one

      11    in my back.  But I want to say he gave me like

      12    two shots in one day in my back, I want to -- in my

      13    spine, I want to say, 'cause it was like -- he said

      14    there was a couple places that was herniated, and

      15    they was inflamed, inflamed or whatever you want to

      16    call it.  Like, it was poofed up or whatever, and

      17    they seen it in the telescope or whatever you want to

      18    call it.

      19               But they inserted the juices in the -- in

      20    my -- in between my disks in my back.  So I want to

      21    say I got like two of those shots in one day, and we

      22    did that procedure in their office.

      23         Q.    So how -- the relief that you got from

      24    those shots, how long did it last?

      25         A.    Oh, shoot.  For a day or two, a day or



                                     32



       1    two.  It ain't -- man, ain't do -- they didn't do too

       2    much of nothing.  The time I went back to the

       3    chiropractor, you know, they like to crack you and

       4    all that stuff.  Like, man, it irritated all that

       5    stuff again.  But, I mean, hey, I mean, there ain't

       6    too much we can do about it.

       7         Q.    So how long did you treat for your

       8    injuries, approximately?

       9         A.    Hey, I treated for a long time.  Now, I

      10    want to say I -- I was going to the chiropractor

      11    faithfully, taking days off of work faithfully.

      12    Like, I needed it.  It wasn't no joking around.  It

      13    wasn't no playing.  Like, I was really messed up.  So

      14    I -- I went probably like two months, I want to say.

      15    I went to a couple visits, I want to say.

      16         Q.    During this time, were you unable to

      17    drive, or were you still able to drive or work?

      18         A.    No, I couldn't.  I couldn't drive.  No.  I

      19    was messed up.  Like, I wasn't -- I wasn't -- I had

      20    to -- the job I had during the accident, I had to

      21    quit that job.  I was driving dump trucks then when

      22    this accident happened.  I had to let that job go

      23    because of the darn injuries.

      24               And because on my -- like I said, my

      25    left-hand shoulder, I cannot hold -- even though it



                                     33



       1    sounds little and it sounds crazy, but I promise you

       2    I could not hold that darn steering wheel.  And I was

       3    in so much pain and stuff and under the influence of

       4    Tylenol, Motrin, and everything to try to take the

       5    pain away, so I had to let that go.

       6         Q.    And you said that -- what company did you

       7    work for at the time of the collision that you had to

       8    quit?

       9         A.    F.S. Scarbrough.  F -- yes, that's it.

      10    Yeah, that's him right there, F.S. Scarbrough.  They

      11    was running a blue dump truck that will be picking up

      12    the dirt off the road and stuff or from the fields

      13    and from the rock yard and stuff like that.  And I

      14    want to say they was -- I can't even remember the

      15    darn -- I'll say -- want to say Fulton.  They was

      16    located in Fulton County, I want to say.  But, yes,

      17    ma'am, I was working for -- I was working for them.

      18               But, I mean, I was out of work.  Once this

      19    accident happened, I was out of work for -- for about

      20    a week before I had to resign, before I had to tell

      21    them I couldn't do it, like.  Like, some days I just

      22    couldn't get out of the bed.  Like, that was the God

      23    honest truth, and I was really -- I was bent up out

      24    of shape.

      25         Q.    And do you know if you're making a lost



                                     34



       1    wage claim?

       2         A.    No, ma'am, I don't think I -- I don't

       3    think I am.  I told you I'm really not knowledgeable

       4    about all these car accidents and what you can do and

       5    what you can't do.

       6         Q.    Well, I --

       7         A.    I just know if you get in a accident and

       8    if you got a CDL, I need to protect my CDL,

       9    especially if I know I'm not a fault.  I need to make

      10    sure I call an attorney, and I know they will help me

      11    with my injuries.

      12               But like I said, I think my injuries was

      13    so significant that the chiropractor and the -- and

      14    the -- and injections that they gave me just wasn't

      15    enough.  I think I probably should have went and

      16    dealt with it.

      17               I think I probably should have surgery,

      18    but like I said, I'm really a chicken when it comes

      19    to having surgeries and stuff like that because I --

      20    I -- I'm the -- I'm the man of the household, so I'm

      21    the provider.  So if I'm down for a month, who's

      22    going to pay my rent?

      23               And people ain't going to care about, oh,

      24    you're out of work because of this and this and that.

      25    Like, I'm out here by myself for real, no moms, no



                                     35



       1    dads, just me and my daughter out there in Atlanta.

       2    So it was -- it was kind of tough.  It's a hard

       3    decision to make, but, I mean, as a -- as a normal

       4    human being, I mean, we got to make those hard

       5    decisions of not having surgery.

       6         Q.    I understand.  I completely understand.

       7    So let's see.  I want to make sure I have some

       8    information from you.  Now, were you discharged from

       9    treatment, or did you quit, stop treatment on your

      10    own?

      11         A.    No, ma'am.  I was discharged.  In fact, I

      12    want to say that place I went to at Riverdale, they

      13    told me, like, this was your last visit and all that

      14    good stuff, that I completed all of my treatments.

      15               They had gave me like a treatment plan, I

      16    want to say, and I completed all of them.  So they

      17    said it was okay.

      18         Q.    Okay.

      19         A.    And there wasn't too much more -- too much

      20    more they can -- they can do, do for me.

      21         Q.    Okay.  Now, I have some of your providers

      22    here.  I want to make sure that I have this right.  I

      23    have that you went to Atlanta Spine.  Does that sound

      24    familiar?

      25         A.    Atlanta Spine?  Yes, ma'am.  That's -- I



                                     36



       1    think that's where I got my injections from, I want

       2    to say, or that's where they told me I got the

       3    herniated disks.

       4         Q.    And then, Georgia Brain -- Georgia Brain

       5    and Spine.  I don't know if that's different or not.

       6    And then, I have you --

       7         A.    Okay.  So yes.  Yes, I remember both of

       8    them.

       9         Q.    Okay.  And then, was it South Atlanta

      10    Urgent Care?

      11         A.    Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  So that's the urgent

      12    care I went to the first day of the accident, yeah.

      13    But like I say, that's the only time I went to a

      14    urgent care.

      15         Q.    Do you recall if you got treatment

      16    anywhere else besides those providers?

      17         A.    I don't.  I just went where my attorney

      18    told me to go, ma'am.

      19         Q.    What I'm asking --

      20         A.    I don't know.

      21         Q.    What I'm asking, did you go see anybody

      22    else?  Like, you know, did you go see your primary

      23    care physician?  Did you go see -- you know, follow

      24    up with urgent care, you know?

      25         A.    No, ma'am.  I just went to this -- I went



                                     37



       1    -- like I said, the day of the accident, I went to

       2    urgent care because I was feeling woozy.  I was

       3    feeling pain.  And there was all kind of stuff wrong,

       4    so I wanted to go check myself out, and I know I went

       5    there.

       6               And honestly, I'm ashamed to say it, but I

       7    don't even have a -- a primary doctor.  I know that's

       8    -- I know that's not right to say, but I don't have

       9    one.  So I -- that's why I went to urgent care.  I

      10    have one now in Texas, though, for sure, for sure.

      11    My wife made sure of that.

      12               But in Atlanta, when I was up there, just

      13    me and my daughter, no, ma'am, I did not have no

      14    primary care doctor.  So the best thing I know is to

      15    go get myself checked out.  And I didn't want to stay

      16    in the hospital for ten hours just for them just to

      17    give me one stinking pill and give me a three- or

      18    four-thousand-dollar bill.  So I just did the next

      19    thing that was the best thing, was go right there to

      20    urgent care.

      21         Q.    So did you have -- I know you said you

      22    don't have a primary care physician.  But have you

      23    ever been diagnosed with any type of underlying

      24    condition like high blood pressure, any heart

      25    conditions, any bone conditions, anything like that?



                                     38



       1         A.    No, ma'am.

       2         Q.    Okay.

       3         A.    I have a clean bill of health now.

       4         Q.    Okay.  Are there any medications that you

       5    take regularly?

       6         A.    No, ma'am.

       7         Q.    And have you ever in your life had surgery

       8    outside of these injections?

       9         A.    Yeah.  Yes, ma'am.  When I was a -- when I

      10    was about eight years old, I was trying to be a

      11    superman in front of a go-kart and tried to stop it

      12    and got my left -- my left leg bent up under the

      13    wheel.  So, yeah, I had surgery.  I broke my leg in

      14    two.

      15         Q.    Oh, okay.

      16         A.    But that's about it, though.  Other than

      17    that, I didn't -- I never had no high blood pressure,

      18    diabetes.  I ain't never had none of that stuff,

      19    so . . .

      20         Q.    Okay.

      21         A.    Just being a -- just being a little -- a

      22    bad little kid, trying to -- trying to be Incredible

      23    Hulk.  That's all that happened to me when I was a

      24    baby.

      25         Q.    So let's see.  So as you sit here today,



                                     39



       1    do you have any pain in your neck and shoulder

       2    currently?

       3         A.    In my shoulder?  Yes.  In my back?  Yes.

       4    I don't --

       5         Q.    In your back --

       6         A.    My neck is okay.

       7         Q.    -- and shoulder.

       8         A.    My neck is okay.

       9         Q.    I'm sorry.  I don't mean -- I meant back

      10    and shoulder, back and shoulder.

      11         A.    Oh, yes, ma'am.  I still have -- I still

      12    have my days when I don't want to do nothing.  And

      13    like I said, it's a ligament in my shoulder.  I just

      14    don't -- I mean, what the doctor told me, said it

      15    probably will never heal.  Honestly, that's what he

      16    told me face to face.

      17               So all I do is now just go to the gym and

      18    just work on -- like, on my shoulders and stuff.

      19    It's in better shape than they was.  But I can tell

      20    you now I'm left-handed, and I can't throw no

      21    football anymore to my son, like, far distance.  It

      22    will pop right out of place, like, off the rotator.

      23    I think that's what it's called, the rotator.

      24               Like, me throwing a softball -- like, see,

      25    I like baseball and football, so -- and I used to



                                     40



       1    have a mean pitch back in the day, but now I can't do

       2    that no more, like, honestly.  Like, so now I've just

       3    got to throw underhanded or stuff like that to be

       4    easy on that -- on that rotator cuff.

       5         Q.    Okay.

       6         A.    So yes, ma'am, I'm still kind of -- I'm

       7    still kind of banged up over here, ma'am.  That

       8    back's still getting me every now and then, walking

       9    around like a little old man sometimes, ma'am.

      10         Q.    So when you have --

      11         A.    And I ain't but 29.

      12         Q.    -- those bad days -- I'm sorry.  So when

      13    you have those bad days, how do you self-treat?

      14         A.    How do I self-treat?

      15         Q.    Uh-huh.

      16         A.    Ma'am, hey, some days is better than

      17    others, I tell you that much.  I mean, I just got to

      18    get up, and I got to do what I got to do.  Like, I

      19    guess that's what any man's mindset is.  I mean, I

      20    got a family.  I mean, that's tough.  That's the only

      21    thing I can say to somebody.  Like, I mean, hey, I

      22    got to pay these bills, man.  I can't really sit here

      23    and complain about it because I'm not about to spend

      24    no 20 or $30,000 for no darn surgery, I tell you that

      25    much.  So, I mean, hey --



                                     41



       1         Q.    Well, do you -- do you take, like,

       2    Tylenol?  Do you use ice packs, do anything like that?

       3         A.    Ma'am --

       4         Q.    Or do you just roll with it?

       5         A.    I use a -- I use a warm pack, you know,

       6    like a warm compress for, like, inflammation.  It

       7    kind of brings it down or something.  I use that.

       8    And I always -- on back of my seat now, like, I even

       9    got, like, the heating pad for, like, the back of my

      10    seat.  So that keeps it -- keeps it, you know what

      11    I'm saying, like, loose and keeps it from hurting so

      12    much.

      13               But it's going to hurt when I start --

      14    when I bend down, twist, pick up anything.  Like, I

      15    mean, you -- I'm pretty sure you're very

      16    knowledgeable about a -- what a -- a herniated disk,

      17    more knowledgeable than me on that situation.

      18               So and I got a few of them in my spine,

      19    so, I mean, it kind of -- it -- like I said, I have

      20    my days when I just want to give up on the world,

      21    ma'am.  But, I mean, hey, you're a parent, and you

      22    can't.

      23         Q.    So let's see.  Are you active on social

      24    media?

      25         A.    Yes, I'm active on social media.



                                     42



       1         Q.    Okay.  What platform do you use?

       2         A.    I'll mostly be on Facebook, honestly.

       3         Q.    Have you ever posted about this collision

       4    on any social media platform?

       5         A.    No.  That ain't nobody's business but mine.

       6         Q.    We lost your video.

       7         A.    Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.

       8         Q.    And as of right now, do you currently have

       9    any plans to seek additional treatment?

      10         A.    I mean, if my -- if my attorney told me

      11    that, that I was covered, yes, ma'am, I will.  Yes,

      12    ma'am.  Yes, ma'am, I will go.  I would go today if I

      13    could.  I definitely -- I definitely could use a

      14    couple more of them injections.  I can tell you that

      15    much, definitely use that, but . . .

      16         Q.    But as far as a surgery is concerned, is

      17    that out of the question right now?

      18         A.    A surgery?

      19         Q.    Yeah.

      20         A.    I mean, ma'am, I just ain't with -- 'cause

      21    I'll be reading too much about people after surgery,

      22    and then the doctor might go in and mess up

      23    something.  Like -- like, no, ma'am, I don't want

      24    them to open me up.  Like, I just want -- I don't

      25    want them to open me up and have to do stuff to me.



                                     43



       1               So, I mean, I'll take, like, medication or

       2    stuff.  But a surgery, though, I mean, that's going

       3    to put me out of work for a -- for a long time.  If

       4    it was a outpatient surgery, then, yeah, I would.

       5    But if it's a -- if you got to sit down for a couple

       6    days, like, I just bought a house in Texas, ma'am, so

       7    I ain't got time to sit down, not right now.

       8         Q.    Now, as it related to the property damage

       9    from the vehicle, I'm assuming that hasn't been

      10    resolved.

      11         A.    The property damage on the vehicle?

      12         Q.    Yeah.  So has that been resolved?  I know

      13    that the vehicle was totaled.  But have you been --

      14    has there been any type of compensation or anything

      15    like that as it relates to the property damage?

      16         A.    I don't want to -- I don't know.

      17         Q.    Okay.

      18         A.    I honestly don't.  I don't even remember

      19    no -- I don't remember Mr. Nichols sending me -- I

      20    think he sent -- didn't he sent -- I don't know.  You

      21    got to --

      22         Q.    I don't know.  We'll talk with --

      23         A.    -- ask him.  I don't know.

      24         Q.    Yeah, let's talk about that offline.

      25    Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.



                                     44



       1               And did you have any cuts, bruising,

       2    scrapes, or swelling or anything like that after the

       3    collision?

       4         A.    (Inaudible).

       5         Q.    I can't hear you.

       6         A.    I want to say I don't -- I don't know if

       7    -- I don't think I had no scrapes or anything.  Only

       8    thing that was bruised up was -- like I said, was my

       9    shoulder, my shoulder.  And I might have tapped my

      10    head on the darn windshield from being jerked around,

      11    but -- on my left, on my left side of my face or

      12    something.  But it wasn't nothing that was just

      13    outstanding where you see me -- like, I was just all

      14    bleeding or just messed up like that.

      15               MS. DOUGLAS:  Okay.  I think those are all

      16         the questions I had.  I'm not sure if your

      17         attorney has any follow-up, but that's all I

      18         have.  Mr. Nichols?

      19               MR. NICHOLS:  Yes.

      20                         EXAMINATION

      21    BY MR. NICHOLS:

      22         Q.    Mr. Harris, as you sit here today, are you

      23    still in pain?

      24         A.    Yes, I am.

      25         Q.    And so would it be beneficial if you were



                                     45



       1    to get additional treatment for the pain that you are

       2    experiencing today?

       3         A.    It would definitely be beneficial, yes,

       4    sir.

       5         Q.    What parts of your body specifically are

       6    still in pain today?

       7         A.    My left shoulder and my midback where the

       8    herniated disks are located at, they still mess with

       9    me.  Every time I pick up something, I got to grab my

      10    back like I'm a 50-year-old man or something.  Like,

      11    man, it's kind of ridiculous, man.

      12         Q.    What about when you're driving?  What is

      13    -- what pain do you experience when you're on the

      14    road?

      15         A.    Man, that's got -- that midsection right

      16    there with those herniated disks, that's when it

      17    really -- honestly, it feels a little better when

      18    I -- when I just walk or when I stand up a little

      19    bit, but when I sit down, that's when it really

      20    irritates me, man.

      21         Q.    And when -- and the herniated disks that

      22    your doctor said that you had, did your doctor say

      23    the herniated disks would be permanent or that it

      24    would heal on its own?

      25         A.    It will be permanent.  Yes, sir, I will



                                     46



       1    have this the rest of my life.  Yes, sir.

       2         Q.    So that means you're going to be

       3    continuing to deal with the problems of the herniated

       4    disks?

       5         A.    Yes, sir.

       6         Q.    Okay.  Now, on the -- the wreck itself, it

       7    happened on Main Street in College Park?

       8         A.    I -- I don't remember the street name, but

       9    yes, sir.

      10         Q.    Do you remember, like, what was close to

      11    it, like, what stores or anything significant, like,

      12    any markers that were nearby?

      13         A.    It was a -- it was a -- the Uber or Lyft,

      14    like a -- where they'll be selling, like, the Teslas,

      15    the electrical cars for, like, the Uber drivers and

      16    stuff.

      17         Q.    Okay.

      18         A.    That -- that's where we had a collision

      19    at, right in front of them.

      20         Q.    Were you close to any, like, airport

      21    parking lots or at the airport or the MARTA station?

      22         A.    I don't know about that, man.  I just

      23    remember -- I just remember the -- I just remember

      24    that -- that Uber, that Uber place because I just

      25    remember the guy got out of his car yelling, saying



                                     47



       1    that I tried to turn in to a -- to this -- this

       2    parking lot.  That's all I remember.

       3         Q.    Okay.  Okay.  Well, all right.  That's all

       4    the questions I have.  Thank you very much,

       5    Mr. Harris.

       6         A.    No problem.

       7               THE COURT REPORTER:  Ms. Douglas, do you

       8         have any more?

       9               MS. DOUGLAS:  No.  Thank you.

      10               THE COURT REPORTER:  Do you want this

      11         transcribed, Ms. Douglas?

      12               MS. DOUGLAS:  Yes.  Yes, please.

      13               THE COURT REPORTER:  Electronic or paper

      14         and electronic?

      15               MS. DOUGLAS:  Electronic only is fine.

      16               THE COURT REPORTER:  Mr. Nichols, do you

      17         need a copy?

      18               MR. NICHOLS:  Not at this time.

      20    11:06 a.m.)
